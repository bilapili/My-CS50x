# My-CS50x
From 2022.8.23 to 2022.11.3, I've finished most assignments of the course(except week9 and Final Project, because I think I've learned enough from the course and there's no need to do the rest homeworks).

The best course for beginers in programing.

Star if it helps you.(It's my honor)

CS50 is my first step to computer science. Next station--CS61A.
